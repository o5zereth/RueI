# Introduction
RueI is a hint framework for scp:sl. the primary component of RueI is the ability to display multiple hints at once, but it also provides a lot of other features to make working with hints easier and more effective.

while RueI is a LabAPI plugin, it primarily acts as a dependency, and other plugin frameworks can use it, too.
